# Find the first item that occurs an even number of times in a list.
# Remember to handle multiple even-occurrence items and return the first one.
# Return null if there are no even-occurrence items.

# example usage:
# onlyEven = evenOccurrence([1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 4]);
# print(onlyEven); //  4
