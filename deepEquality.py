# Write a function that, given two dictionaries, returns whether or not the two
# are deeply equivalent--meaning the structure of the two dictionaries is the
# same, and so is the structure of each of their corresponding descendants.
#
# Examples:
#
# deepEquals({a:1, b: {c:3}},{a:1, b: {c:3}}); // true
# deepEquals({a:1, b: {c:5}},{a:1, b: {c:6}}); // false
#
# Don't worry about handling cyclical dictionary structures.
